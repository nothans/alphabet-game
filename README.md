# Alphabet Asteroids

Alphabet Asteroids is a fun, single-page educational web game designed to help children learn the English alphabet. In the game, asteroids bearing letters fall from the sky, and the player must type the correct letter before the asteroid reaches the bottom. With each complete round of the alphabet, the game advances through different levels with unique challenges!

## Levels

* Level 1: Asteroids fall at a constant speed.
* Level 2: Asteroids fall at randomized speeds.
* Level 3: A three-strike rule is introduced—if an asteroid reaches the bottom, a strike is recorded; three strikes end the game.
* Level 4 (Boss Level): The falling asteroids do not display their letters.
